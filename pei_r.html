        <h1>Why did I choose to come to Prince Edward Island?</h1>
        <p>
          The 15 years and half of my flying career passed so fast, and in the
          last 2 years of them I felt like it was time to do something else.
          Flying is very addictive, and even though it has been almost 3 years
          since I left it, I still miss it badly. I started to realize that I
          need to start doing something completely different, because I would
          not be flying forever. I thought maybe I should make a career shift,
          or go back to university and study something interesting. I rested my
          mind on going back to studies, however I wanted like to do that in a
          different way. I wanted to do my studies out of my home country, and I
          wanted to do it in a place that is so different and unfamiliar to me.
          Then, I started doing my research about that, and I came across the
          program of island studies at Prince Edward Island University. I said
          that was it, I have to go there. I was interested in the nature of the
          program itself as it was concerned with studying islands, and I was
          also so impressed with the idea of going and spending two years in
          Prince Edward Island.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was supposed to be doing my studies starting September 2020, however
          due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I asked the university if I could come
          in September 2021 instead, and luckily it was fine and they accepted
          that. In that year before coming here, I started reading a lot about
          Prince Edward Island, and thought it was kind of a very island
          beautiful destination with lots of scenery. At that point, I had no
          clue about islands in an academic way the way I’m now, I was not even
          aware that islands are categorized as warm water and cold water
          islands. I was not that knowledgeable about the effect of climate
          change on the environment, and on the ecosystem. I had no idea also
          about over-tourism and the danger of that on islands, and also the
          scarcity of natural resources and the importance of protecting that.
          When I was flying to any islands, I was like any other tourists or
          visitors who were just there to enjoy the destination and have fun,
          and do not care about anything else more or less.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started my island studies program, I started seeing islands in
          a different way. I saw the bigger picture about all this. Doing these
          studies really enlightened me a lot, and if it happens that I could
          visit any islands again in the future, I would think and behave in a
          different way. As they always say: Knowledge is Power, and this is so
          true.

        <h1>
          Facts I discovered about Prince Edward Island when I arrived there
        </h1>

        <p>
          I arrived on the 26th of August 2021. My start here was not a very
          pleasant one, as they put me in quarantine for 14 days, and I got
          released on the 7th of September, which was only one day before the
          start of classes. It would have been a great idea to discover the
          island in those 14 days, which was also the end of the summer season,
          and to have an idea about the new place that I would live in.
          Unfortunately, I was not allowed to leave the quarantine at all, so
          basically I felt as if I was in a kind of confinement. My hotel room
          did not even have a nice view, and I was facing the parking lot as I
          remember.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another thing I was not aware of, is that you need to drive to all the
          tourist attractions, and they are very far away from the city of
          Charlottetown where I was living. You have to have a car or rent one,
          or go with a friend. I started looking for tourism companies that
          arrange tours and provide pick up and drop off, but they were all
          closed because of the covid pandemic. I was so frustrated, and all I
          was doing was discovering Charlottetown only through walking. When we
          started classes, I became friends with two of my classmates Helena and
          Henry (Henry is the one I’m doing this website project with; he is my
          project partner). Helena had a car and we managed to go out a couple
          of times only, because we were so busy with our studies, and the
          weather started to get cold. With Henry as well, we used to explore
          things in Charlottetown together through cycling, and sometimes when
          he takes the car from his cousin. Henry is an international student
          like me, and he is from Taiwan, and it was also his first time in
          Prince Edward Island. Helena was from Ontario and originally from the
          Azores Islands, and it was her first time in Prince Edward Island as
          well. I was happy that I made two friends who are originally from
          island backgrounds.

        <h1>Things I have done so far in Prince Edward Island</h1>

        <p>
          I still have to explore Prince Edward Island properly, and check out
          many places I have not been to yet. I live in Charlottetown, which is
          considered the capital of Prince Edward Island. I'm lucky that I live
          in the heart of the city, and I explored most of its surroundings. I
          have been to the Confederation Centre of Arts, which is located
          downtown and offers some art and heritage programs that talk about the
          history of the place and about canada. I have also visited the
          Victoria Park Boardwalk, which was luckily close to all the apartments
          I rented, and I used to go there to exercise or simply walk on the
          edge to meditate and reflect about things. The Fall season is so
          beautiful in Prince Edward Island, and the tree leaves start to have
          the colors of yellow, brown, maroon, gold and copper before the fall
          off, and seeing that was so magical. I have been with my friend Henry
          to Bonshaw Hills Provincial Park, as we walked some trails there to
          check the fall colorful leaves. We also did some trail cycling as
          well, we went to the Sherwood Trail, and we rode bicycles there, as
          the weather was still sunny and nice.
        </p>

        <p>
          With Helena, I went on a long road trip with her, and Helena loved
          checking out the Lighthouses and wanted to see the one at West Point.
          Prince Edward Island has a lot of Lighthouses. We drove all the way
          there, which was a very long drive, and we got lost so many times,
          however, we were checking other stuff on our way as well. We stopped
          by Cow’s Factory, and it was often referred to as Canada’s best ice
          cream. We saw how they made other things there such as chocolates,
          t-shirts and cheese, we had some delicious ice cream of course as well
          from there. On our way to West Point, we stopped to take pictures with
          the windmills in Miscouche, as there were plenty of them. Because we
          got lost so many times on our way to West Point Lighthouse, we managed
          to arrive there by sunset, and we captured very nice photos and
          videos. On our way back, we were so hungry and we said we would eat in
          Charlottetown, and it was quite late so only the Hunter’s Ale House
          was open. The food was not that great there, but Helena and I were so
          busy talking about our trip and checking out the photos we took.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are other few places that I also visited with organized tours by
          university, because being in the island tourism program, we got so
          lucky to go out and see some interesting things. Together with my
          classmates we went to visit the Beaconsfield Historic House, and there
          you will get to see how life was during the Victorian Era, and what
          the Victorian houses looked like inside, and their lifestyle and
          habits. We also went on another trip to Port Charlottetown, to get an
          idea about cruise tourism. At that time we went there, it was closed
          due to the covid pandemic, but was planned to open in the summer of
          2022. We also checked the surroundings there, and we entered
          Receiver's Coffee at Founders Mall to have some morning pastries and
          coffee. We were all chilled in the outdoor seating area while having
          them. We had an assignment where each one of us had to go to a place
          of our own choice, and then write a paper about what we experienced
          there. I had chosen Port-La-Joye Fort Amherst, as it was a place of an
          important significant history of Prince Edward Island, and I highly
          recommend it, as it gives a better understanding of important
          historical incidents that happened there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other times I went out was during winter, as I had my sister and
          brother in law visiting me in December 2022. They wanted to see the
          famous attractions of Prince Edward Island such as: Cavendish, Anne of
          Green Gables House, Greenwich Beach, Sandspit Amusement park, Shining
          Waters Family Fun Park and the Haunted Mansion. I kept on telling them
          that these places are seasonal and they are only open during the
          summer time, however they still insisted on going there. They said
          they wanna check these places out even if they are closed, to get an
          idea about them and plan another trip in summer. I also did not manage
          to visit any of them myself during the summer, because as I explained
          above you need a car to go there. The thing I liked the most when my
          sister visited me was that I got to see the Confederation Bridge from
          a distance, and we also visited the Air Force Heritage Park in
          Summerside, where they have a collection of military aircraft displays
          that were used many years ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          I managed to find a part time job working as a night auditor, in a
          great historic boutique hotel that is very well known in
          Charlottetown, and it is called: The Great George Hotel. I became
          friends with so many wonderful colleagues there, some of them are from
          the island, while others were international students like in my case.
          My best friend from there is Oliver, and we managed to go out a lot,
          especially to the different restaurants of Charlottetown. We have been
          to The Merchant Man, Piatto, Cedar’s Eatery, Papa Joe’s, Sim’s
          Steakhouse, The Gahan House, Ta Ke Sushi and Water’s Edge. I recommend
          visiting the Great George Hotel, as it is a very iconic place, and
          they have the famous St. Dunstan’s Basilica Cathedral in front of it,
          so both could be visited at the same time.

        <h1>Islandness in Prince Edward Island</h1>

        <p>
          Since Prince Edward Island is my first experience on a cold water
          island, Islandness and its meanings are kind of different when it
          comes to it. Unlike tropical islands that are always sunny, and
          usually when the place is sunny it brings with it feelings of
          happiness and warmth, Prince Edward Island gives me a bit of
          bitterness. I Love Prince Edward Island so much though, since I have
          been here for almost two years now. However, maybe because it is a
          cold water island and seasonal, I keep on thinking that I'm away from
          everyone that I know. There are oceans and miles between here and my
          home country, where my family are. I think islanders or people who
          have their families with them will have different feelings towards it,
          maybe they have a certain bond towards it, and they do not have those
          gloomy or somber thoughts about the island.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, I managed to experience feelings of vulnerability and resilience
          during the huge Fiona Hurricane that happened last September 2022. It
          was a great learning experience for me to witness how islands are so
          vulnerable, and that people should be together, and have a sense of
          the power of community, in order to overcome the obstacles they are
          prone to face on islands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prince Edward Island is my first cold water island experience, I
          really would like to explore more cold water ones. I'm hoping that my
          next cold water island destination will be Iceland, as it was always
          my dream to visit it. I would like to go there for like 10 days to
          explore the wonderful tourist attractions, as I tend to go crazy
          whenever I see or read anything related to Iceland. My love for
          islands is forever, and I'm so grateful that I had the opportunity to
          visit some of them; whether they were tropical, cold or artificial
          ones. They are all great and worth being seen and explored.
