        <h1>Where in Australia?</h1>
        <p>
          I was lucky enough to visit the continent of Australia several times.
          I visited Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane there. Since Australia is
          surrounded by the ocean, they often refer to it as an island
          continent. It is full of immigrants, as Australia is one of the
          immigration destinations as USA and Canada. There, you find immigrant
          people from every race, and also they have the Aboriginal Australians
          who are the indigenous people of Australia. If you need a community
          from your home country that would be very easy to find in Australia,
          as there is the Lebanese community, Egyptian community, Korean
          community and so on and so forth. Everyone who ever visited Australia
          fell in love with it. There is a feeling of warmth and happiness that
          runs through the whole continent. It is always sunny in Australia, so
          I think that is one of the reasons why people are so happy there. Most
          of the people there are healthy, always working out, and tend to eat
          healthy food. Australia also is so green, so it is tempting to eat
          outside and do all the activities outdoors. The meat, fruits and
          vegetables are amazing in Australia, and they are so fresh. If you
          like steaks and excellent wine, then definitely Australia is the place
          for you.

        <h1>Before going to Australia</h1>
        <p>
          One of the things people need to know before going to Australia is
          that they have strict rules that everyone who is landing and entering
          Australia has to follow. I remember we used to make a lot of passenger
          announcements in that flight that any animal or dairy products, or
          decorations that are made of wood, or shoes that have certain insoles
          on them, or anything that has a soil attached to it are strictly not
          allowed. There are serious fines and confiscations that happen in
          Australian airports, and they do a lot of random checks to search bags
          as well, and there are always the service dogs to sniff the bags on
          the baggage carousel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second thing to check before going there is the weather. The
          weather in Australia is opposite to the weather in so many
          destinations of the world. The weather is similar to the one in South
          Africa, both of those destinations have their Christmas during the
          summertime for example, where December there is a hot summer season.
          When it comes to Winter, August is considered the winter in Australia
          and South Africa for instance. So, before you plan your trip, and
          let’s say it falls in August, you need to pack with winter clothes,
          boots and jackets, whereas if your vacation falls in December, you
          need to carry with you shorts, swimsuits and flip flops. Therefore,
          being updated and knowledgeable about the weather in Australia is
          extremely important
        </p>
        <p>
          Third advice is the extreme importance of carrying sunscreen
          protection, as the UV rays there are so harmful. Also, keep in mind
          that Australia has a lot of insects, bugs and different other
          creatures such as reptiles and snakes, so you need to take your
          precautions and get more updated about that, especially if you will do
          outdoor activities in nature.

        <h1>Sydney</h1>
        <p>
          Sydney is a very popular destination, and it has a lot of immigrants,
          especially Lebanese. It is so vibrant and full of life, and has a lot
          of things to explore. If you are downtown, most of the attractions are
          within walking distance from each other. You can visit the famous
          Sydney Bridge, by either booking a tour to climb it, or just to see it
          from a distance where you could still capture some great photos. A
          visit to Sydney Opera House is definitely a must, as the opera house
          has a very unique structure, it is shaped like the mists of sailing
          boats. You can book a guided tour of the opera, and they have
          different packages for that. If you decide not to enter, you can walk
          by and capture some photos as well. Darling Harbour is a great
          location to have a nice dinner, especially if you would like to visit
          a steakhouse. After you finish the delicious steak, do not forget to
          try one of Australia’s famous desserts which is sticky date pudding.
