        <h1>Where in Australia?</h1>
        <p>
          I was lucky enough to visit the continent of Australia several times.
          I visited Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane there. Since Australia is
          surrounded by the ocean, they often refer to it as an island
          continent. It is full of immigrants, as Australia is one of the
          immigration destinations as USA and Canada. There, you find immigrant
          people from every race, and also they have the Aboriginal Australians
          who are the indigenous people of Australia. If you need a community
          from your home country that would be very easy to find in Australia,
          as there is the Lebanese community, Egyptian community, Korean
          community and so on and so forth. Everyone who ever visited Australia
          fell in love with it. There is a feeling of warmth and happiness that
          runs through the whole continent. It is always sunny in Australia, so
          I think that is one of the reasons why people are so happy there. Most
          of the people there are healthy, always working out, and tend to eat
          healthy food. Australia also is so green, so it is tempting to eat
          outside and do all the activities outdoors. The meat, fruits and
          vegetables are amazing in Australia, and they are so fresh. If you
          like steaks and excellent wine, then definitely Australia is the place
          for you.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Before going to Australia</h1>
        <p>
          One of the things people need to know before going to Australia is
          that they have strict rules that everyone who is landing and entering
          Australia has to follow. I remember we used to make a lot of passenger
          announcements in that flight that any animal or dairy products, or
          decorations that are made of wood, or shoes that have certain insoles
          on them, or anything that has a soil attached to it are strictly not
          allowed. There are serious fines and confiscations that happen in
          Australian airports, and they do a lot of random checks to search bags
          as well, and there are always the service dogs to sniff the bags on
          the baggage carousel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second thing to check before going there is the weather. The
          weather in Australia is opposite to the weather in so many
          destinations of the world. The weather is similar to the one in South
          Africa, both of those destinations have their Christmas during the
          summertime for example, where December there is a hot summer season.
          When it comes to Winter, August is considered the winter in Australia
          and South Africa for instance. So, before you plan your trip, and
          let’s say it falls in August, you need to pack with winter clothes,
          boots and jackets, whereas if your vacation falls in December, you
          need to carry with you shorts, swimsuits and flip flops. Therefore,
          being updated and knowledgeable about the weather in Australia is
          extremely important
        </p>
        <p>
          Third advice is the extreme importance of carrying sunscreen
          protection, as the UV rays there are so harmful. Also, keep in mind
          that Australia has a lot of insects, bugs and different other
          creatures such as reptiles and snakes, so you need to take your
          precautions and get more updated about that, especially if you will do
          outdoor activities in nature.

      <div>
        <h1>Sydney</h1>
        <p>
          Sydney is a very popular destination, and it has a lot of immigrants,
          especially Lebanese. It is so vibrant and full of life, and has a lot
          of things to explore. If you are downtown, most of the attractions are
          within walking distance from each other. You can visit the famous
          Sydney Bridge, by either booking a tour to climb it, or just to see it
          from a distance where you could still capture some great photos. A
          visit to Sydney Opera House is definitely a must, as the opera house
          has a very unique structure, it is shaped like the mists of sailing
          boats. You can book a guided tour of the opera, and they have
          different packages for that. If you decide not to enter, you can walk
          by and capture some photos as well. Darling Harbour is a great
          location to have a nice dinner, especially if you would like to visit
          a steakhouse. After you finish the delicious steak, do not forget to
          try one of Australia’s famous desserts which is sticky date pudding.

      <div>
        <h1>Melbourne</h1>
        <p>
          Unlike Sydney that has a lot of Lebanese communities, Melbourne has a
          large Greek Community, as well as Italians. Melbourne is very dynamic,
          and the life rhythm there is so busy. Tourist attractions there have a
          different vibe than Sydney. They are more like street sightseeing,
          where you get to see a lot of old architecture, and many museums and
          street arts. Once you land in Melbourne, start the day so early and
          wear very comfortable walking shoes, as you will be doing a lot of
          walking there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by seeing the Street Arts, where you find the Graffiti Art on
          the walls there so popular, and Melbourne is considered one of the
          cities that is very renowned for it. Pay a visit to the Botanic
          Gardens, where you can forget the urban city life for a bit, and relax
          in a wonderful green nature. A lot of people are doing their walk or
          run exercise over there. If you are fan of open food markets, then you
          must visit Queen Victoria Markets, where you can buy cheese, olives
          and sweets. Some stalls also sell handicrafts, and they often run
          interesting events there.

        <p>
          If you love shopping like me, then Melbourne is definitely the place
          for that. They have huge shoppings malls, and a lot of shopping
          streets that have varieties of international and Australian products,
          visit Chapel Street and Bridge street for a day of a shopping spree.
          Since there are a lot of Greek and Italian communities in Melbourne,
          you need to try the delicious Greek cuisine by going to the Greek
          District, where you get to try authentic Greek food prepared by Greeks
          themselves. If you are a fan of Italian food, then visit Lygon
          District where you can have espresso in the Italian cafes, and get to
          buy some Italian products, as well as indulge in the Italian authentic
          cuisine prepared by Italians there.

        <h1>Brisbane</h1>
        <p>
          Brisbane is a very calm destination where life is so slow and relaxed
          in comparison to Sydney and Melbourne. It has the ambience of the
          countryside, and the people there are very nice. I was lucky that I
          spent the new year of 2009 there once with my colleagues from the
          flight. We started New Year’s Eve by having dinner all together, and
          then we started walking the streets of Brisbane downtown, waiting for
          the fireworks over the bridge at midnight. What drew my attention
          while walking is an area called South Bank Parklands on River
          Brisbane. They are located in the heart of the city, and they are free
          public swimming pools that form a big lagoon, on a man-made sandy
          beach. On New Year’s Eve, it was crowded with people, families and
          kids that were swimming there the whole night and early morning. After
          that, we headed and climbed the Story Bridge, where you eat to witness
          the countdown and watch the beautiful fireworks. It was also very
          packed and crowded with people, however the vibes of that night were
          really nice.

        <p>
          One of the places worth visiting in Brisbane is the Lone Pine Koala
          Sanctuary, where you see the wildlife, and get to see Australia's
          kangaroos and Koalas. They have packages there that have entrance fees
          with sessions to hold the Koalas, and take pictures and videos with
          them. One tip of advice is that if you are scared of animals or scared
          to hold koalas, do not choose the package that involves holding and
          carrying them. I was a bit nervous and the Koala that I held felt it,
          and then it got scared and refused to take pictures with other guests.
          The guards were very mad at me, and blamed me for scaring the koala,
          and they were totally right. I was just selfish and wanted to take
          pictures with it anyhow.

          On another flight that I had to Brisbane, myself and one of my friends
          in the flight decided to visit the Gold Coast. We took the train from
          Brisbane for an hour and a half and arrived there. It was like a
          magical paradise, and the hotel we stayed there was even called:
          Surfers Paradise. The hotel is like a skyscraper with lots of rooms
          with breathtaking views of the ocean. There are a lot of restaurants,
          swimming suit shops, cafes and lots of surfing learning companies
          across the beach. It is very crowded during the high seasons, and the
          best thing to do is to go for night walks, and observe the moon over
          the ocean, especially if it is a full moon. There are lots of night
          markets at night, and most of the people are out of their hotels
          enjoying the place.

        <h1>Islandness in Australia</h1>
        <p>
          Since Australia is a continental island, I could not relate the
          meanings of islandness to it at all. The only exception to that is my
          Gold Coast visit. Although Australia is geographically considered a
          continent island, I guess people who live there do not feel that they
          are living on an island either. To me, I consider it a huge mainland
          with the rhythm of a busy city. However at the Gold Coast, I felt that
          I was on a tropical island, the same way as I felt when I visited
          Boracay or Maldives. I felt like I was in a recreational resort on the
          Gold Coast, where I could do a lot of water sports, eat seafood, and
          sunbathe. For sure there are other aspects of Australia that I’m
          missing which might carry the meanings of islandness in them, or to
          people who explored Australia in more depth and spent more time there,
          where they could relate to that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite not being able to find meanings and connections to the notion
          of islandness there, Australia is still one of my favorite
          destinations that I have been to. It has its own magical charm that
          can capture anyone’s heart. Some of the immigrants that I know who
          lived there for sometime love it deeply, and would like to continue
          the rest of their lives in Australia.
