        <h1>Ocean</h1>
        <p>
          PEI is renowned for its stunning coastline, which includes countless
          beaches and the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. From the deep
          blues of the ocean to the soft white sands of the beaches, there is
          much to love about the natural beauty of Prince Edward Island's ocean
          and beach landscapes. One of the most popular beaches on the island is
          Brackley Beach, which features a long boardwalk that runs along the
          sand and provides stunning views of the ocean. The beach is also
          surrounded by lush green forests and rolling hills, adding to the
          natural beauty of the area. Prince Edward Island's beaches are
          relatively quiet and uncrowded, providing the perfect setting for a
          peaceful day by the water. Visitors can relax in the sun, read a book,
          or simply watch the waves roll in and out, enjoying the peaceful
          serenity of the ocean and beach environment.

          Last June, also my first summer in PEI. I got a chance to join beach
          cleanup activity. While walking on the Stanhope beach in PEI National
          Park. The water was warm and transparent, but what made me more
          surprised was the sand. It was white, clean, and sparkling. Generally,
          the beach is really clean, just some waste from fisheries activities.
          I am glad that I could have this chance to cooperate with Park Canada
          to prepare clean beaches for tourists in the following traveling
          season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Laying on a beach to watch sunset and star was another unforgettable
          thing I did in PEI. When my friend, Jason visited in June. I took him
          to Brackley beach to watch sunset. After the sun went down to the
          ocean. The sky started to be dark, and this is the moment I am waiting
          for. There is no light on PEI beach, so it provides a perfect place
          for star watching. Tens of thousands of stars were on the sky at that
          night. It is difficult to take the pics of that star sky via Phone
          Camera, it is one of the things must to do in person. If there is any
          other friend visited me in the future in summer, I will take them to
          watch stars again.

        <h1>Red Sand and Potatoes</h1>
        <p>
          The red sand in PEI is also one of the famous island characteristics.
          The soil gets its characteristic red color from the high iron oxide
          content. PEI red sand has several properties that make it ideal for
          agriculture. PEI red sand is known for its high nutrient content, and
          this is why potatoes are so famous in PEI. Red sand is porous and
          allows for good drainage of water, which can help prevent issues such
          as waterlogging and rotting of potato crops. It is also known to have
          a lower risk of soil-borne diseases compared to other types of soil.
          This can help reduce the risk of diseases affecting potato crops,
          which can lead to higher yields and better-quality potatoes. I donâ€™t
          eat potatoes so much before moving to PEI, but undoubtedly the
          potatoes here are so amazing. the taste of PEI potatoes is rich,
          creamy, and sweet. They are really unique to what I ate in Taiwan.

        <p>
          Another connection with Red Sand in PEI is Cavendish in PEI National
          Park. Same trip with Jason. We went to the Cove in Cavendish and took
          some funny pictures there. It was impressive that There are many
          coastal terrains in PEI National Park. In Brackley and Stanhope is
          white sand, but we can see the red sand coast in Cavendish. The
          distance between these two places are only 20 minutes by car.
          Unfortunately, Hurricane Fiona changed many things in the North Coast
          severely. When I went to Cavendish again with another friends Paul in
          the mid of November. The Cove was gone. It made me understand how
          vulnerable of islands when climate change happened.

        <h1>the Confederation Bridge and the connection to mainland</h1>
        <p>
          I still remembered my first time to visit the Confederation Bridge,
          which is the longest bridge in the world crossing ice-covered water.
          This bridge crosses of the Northumberland Strait, linking the province
          of Prince Edward Island (PEI) with the province of New Brunswick on
          the mainland. The weather on that day was still cold, around zero
          degree. The wind was so really strong that I thought I could be blown
          away. However, I still chose to get off the car, just for taking
          memorable pictures. This was my first time to see ice floating on the
          water, and thus I must take some photos to grasp that special moment
          no matter how cold it was.
        </p>
        <h4>

          alt="twin"
          class="imginwordthree"
        />
        <p>
          Before going to the Bridge, I had no idea how importance of the bridge
          to PEI. I remembered there was a session about the Bridge in my first
          class, Themes and Perspectives in Island Studies. At that time, I
          could not understand why islanders were so excited that the bridge
          opened to traffic on May 31, 1997. The Bridge is just a transportation
          infrastructure, but why islander can be so emotional in that
          discussion? Since I visited the bridge, I could understand that
          feeling. Without the bridge, I could image that islanders are really
          isolated in the winter time. I had the same feeling for my first
          winter in PEI. I could feel loneliness and isolated while living in
          Prince Edward Island, where is no so much fun to do here in winter. I
          felt bored and kind of stuck on the island until I took a road trip to
          Halifax, and this was the chance for me to visit the Bridge in winter.
          After crossing the Bridge, I started to feel that I reconnected to the
          world. Because of the winter, the covered ice on the ocean, the
          freezing temperature and few friends here at that time, I felt more
          isolated while living in Prince Edward Island. I even asked myself why
          I do not live in Taiwan instead. The winter in Taiwan is warm and I
          have more fun things to do there. Therefore, I could understand why
          the bridge is so important after going through my first winter in PEI.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the June, I got my second chance to visit the Bridge, and I went
          there with my Taiwanese friend, who flew from Illinois to Prince
          Edward Island just for visiting this beautiful island. I was like a
          local people and took a tourist to visit several tourist spots on the
          island, and the bridge is one of the top-rated spots here. I still
          remembered that the weather was so lovely at that day. While the wind
          from the Northumberland Strait kissed on my cheek from time to time.
          How enjoyable the live is! My friend and I sat on the bench and
          watched cars entering PEI one by one. It looked like retired people
          who enjoy their summer beside the coast. The sunshine splatters on the
          sea and make the blue brighter. The view of the bridge on that day was
          so breathtaking. I am still struggling to find a word to describe it.
          The feeling on that day made me understand that the season great for
          going to the coast is back. In other words, the touristâ€™s season of
          PEI is back, and the Bridge would take its responsibility to bring
          road-trip tourists to PEI. PEI became more energetic again and it was
          not a lonely island, which made me feel isolated in the winter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bridge reminds me the physical broader of an island. In the daily
          life, I do not go to the coast so often, and thus it is difficult to
          tell I am living in mainland or island. While getting close to the
          coast, I started to remember I am living in an island and ocean is
          still a physical obstacle for me to leave island by car. Fortunately,
          the construction of bridge can make island reconnect to mainland
          again, but I never have this experience before coming to PEI. Taiwan
          is an island as well, but the size of it is much larger than that of
          PEI. Therefore, I could not feel that I am actually on an island, not
          to mention the feeling of loneliness what I had here in the winter
          time. However, when I want to leave Taiwan, I need to go to the
          airport. Therefore, my connection of leaving an island is always an
          airport. By contrast, people in PEI gets a chance to leave here by
          car. People can drive 13 kilometers and arrive New Brunswick or even
          the whole Canada. This experience is new to me. The Bridge made me
          realize that I can go to the coast to leave an island instead of going
          to an airport.

        <h1>Major city â€“ Charlottetown</h1>
        <p>
          When my friend Paul, visiting me from London. I got a chance to give
          him a one-day trip, and the following is what we did in Charlottetown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul is a big fan of coffee, so I took him to a cafÃ©â€™ to start for a
          day. The cafÃ©â€™ I took him to was Alambeâ€™, the one on the Kent Street.
          The cafÃ©â€™ is opened by a Vietnamese family and the owner have over 30
          yearsâ€™ experiences in coffee roasting and he used to be a coffee bean
          trader in Vietnamese before immigrating to Canada. Paul and I have
          been to Vietnam together three years ago, and both of us like
          Vietnamese coffee. This was one of the reasons I took him to Alambeâ€™.
          The other reason I chose Alambeâ€™ instead of Receiver cafÃ©â€™ was the
          story of Alambeâ€™ owner. The business owner had a great business in
          Vietnam, but he still chose to give up those business in Vietnam and
          immigrated to Canada. What he pursued was to give his children better
          lifestyles as well as better education. Immigration is not easy.
          Everything here should start from scratch, not to mention that English
          is still the obstacle for many immigrants. However, owing to give
          their children a better learning environment, those Asian families
          still choose to give up their good life qualities in their hometowns
          and come to Canada. This kind of immigration story is rare in London
          or big cities in Canada, such as Toronto because the costs to afford
          the whole family in those cities are incredibly high. Therefore,
          Charlottetown will be an ideal option for those Asian families and
          they are trying their best to integrate in PEI local lives as well as
          make contribution to PEI (Alam, 2022).

        />
        <p>
          After the conversation in Alambeâ€™, I took Paul to Port Charlottetown.
          There were two cruises docking at Charlottetown at that day (Port
          Charlottetown, 2022), and thus Paul got a chance to feel the vibe of
          Charlottetown when cruises visit us. After taking pictures with two
          cruises, Paul and I walked on the boardwalk to enjoy cozy winds from
          ocean. We also took some pictures at 2022 display to memorize the year
          we travelled together in PEI. In addition to breathtaking ocean
          sceneries, having seafood is another to-do thing in Charlottetown
          (Prince Edward Island, 2022). Oysters, scallops, mussels are all
          delicious seafood Paul cannot miss. Because clean, cold Atlantic
          waters surrounding PEI (Lobster Fishers of Prince Edward Island
          Marketing Board, 2022), lobster is another must-ordered cuisine for
          Paul. One interesting thing should be mentioned is that Paul also
          ordered fish and chip in the seafood restaurant. He said that he
          wanted to compare the one here and England. According to Paul, the
          fish and chip in PEI was much better than that in London. As the
          birthplace of fish and chip (Royal Museums Greenwich, 2022), the one
          in London should be better, but Paul told me a totally different
          story. I guessed why fish and chip in PEI defeated that in London
          because the ingredients. PEI has the advantage of offering fresh
          haddock and delicious potatoes to make fish and chips (Greenway &
          Guenthner, 2022)
        </p>

        <p>
          After having a big feast, we went to confederation center of the arts
          to understand Canadian history. At the second floor of the
          confederation center of the arts, there is a desk to demonstrate how
          representatives from colonies of British North America had the meeting
          in Charlottetown. When we were there, we could imagine how John
          Alexander Macdonald and other fathers of Canadian Confederation made
          the preliminary charcoal sketch in Charlottetown (Confederation Center
          of the Arts, 2022). After learning Canadian history, it was the time
          to get some dessert. Cows is nearby confederation center of the arts.
          After trying worldâ€™s best ice cream in PEI. Paul said the ice cream in
          PEI is much better than those Cowâ€™s stores in other cities, such as
          Quebec. We had visited Quebec before traveling in PEI.

          After having great Chinese cuisines in DJ Wok for supper, we started
          to find some fun for our nightlife. After living in London for a year,
          grabbing a drink in bars is already a lifestyle for Paul. However,
          because it was the off-season for PEI, there were few restaurants
          opened in October. Therefore, Paul didnâ€™t get a chance enjoy bar
          surfing in Charlottetown, but he did find a great bar here. The one we
          went is Hopyard. The distinguishing feature of this bar is the battle
          of the breweries. There is a competition for local breweries in
          Hopyard, and thus we can try different special local craft beer there.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the one-day trip, Paul has shared some differences he found
          between U.K. and PEI. I only listed three examples here. The first one
          is the design of houses. Some Victorian style houses can be found in
          PEI, but he still could tell the difference from those in U.K.
          Secondly, tips culture is uncommon in U.K., and thus he was not used
          to it when we dined in. The last one is road design. According to his
          city planning perspective, Canada is a car-oriented country. The
          public transportation in downtown Charlottetown is still not
          convenient. Based on the above three observations, he thought Canada
          is more like United States than U.K. although Canada used to have
          close connection with U.K.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traveling with Paul in Charlottetown is a funny and meaningful
          experience. We enjoyed the oceanic sceneries and great cuisines here
          as well as learnt Canadian history. At the same time, Paul got a
          chance to compare the life in PEI and London as well as see Canadian
          immigrant policies in person, and how Canada becomes a more and more
          diverse country, even in a city with only 40,000 population.

        <h1>Islandness of PEI</h1>
        <p>
          After living in PEI one and half year. I wanted to share how I feel
          about PEI. Generally, my Isandness of PEI is quietness, peace,
          seafood, ocean, red sand, splendid beaches and British cultures. The
          influence of Britain can still be found in Charlottetown. It is
          similar that Taiwan has kept many Chinese cultures. Quietness and
          peace is why I feel so comfortable while living in PEI, but if the
          winter went too long, It made me feel lonely instead, especially in
          the end of March and the early April. The spring is supposed to come,
          but why we still get snow during that period. At that moment, I did
          have a strong motivation to escape to tropical islands.
