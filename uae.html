        <h1>Paradise: The Isle of Skye</h1>
        <p>
          The Isle of Skye is a rugged and beautiful island located in the
          northwest of Scotland. It is the largest of the Inner Hebrides islands
          and is known for its stunning landscapes, rich history, and vibrant
          culture. Geographically, Skye is characterized by its mountainous
          terrain, with the Cuillin Range dominating the island's skyline. The
          island also has numerous lochs, including the famous Loch Coruisk,
          which is surrounded by steep cliffs and waterfalls. The island's
          culture is deeply rooted in Gaelic tradition, and the language is
          still spoken by some of the residents. The island has a rich history,
          with evidence of human habitation dating back thousands of years. Skye
          has also played an important role in Scottish history, with many
          battles and conflicts taking place on the island. In terms of
          attractions, Skye has many natural wonders, such as the Fairy Pools,
          the Old Man of Storr, and the Quiraing. The island is also home to
          many historic sites, such as Dunvegan Castle and the Museum of Island
          Life.

        <h1>One the way to The Isle of Skye</h1>
        <p>
          9 a.m., We left Edinburgh to begin our highland journey, and we are
          scheduled to arrive in the evening on the Isle of Skye. I could image
          this will be a long with the weather getting worse and worse. I was
          expecting three days of rain on our highland expedition.
          Unsurprisingly, the sky has changed from blue to grey since we left
          Edinburgh. The rain became heavier as we travelled. My mood is easy to
          be influenced by the weather, and thus I thought I won’t be excited on
          my highland trip, but I still tried to make myself enjoy every moment
          during the trip. The rain didn’t stop for around six hours, and thus I
          guessed the weather of the Isle of Skye would be worse. What’s more, I
          didn’t sleep well last night, so I thought I would fall asleep while
          arriving the hotel. Surprisingly, since we arrived Fort William, the
          largest city before going to the Isle of Skye. The blue sky started to
          say hello and welcome us. Interestingly, I became excited again and
          looked forward to the days on the Isle of Skye. After 90 minutes ride,
          we finally arrived the Isle of Skye, and the weather was sunny as
          expected. We also got an opportunity to watch sunset when we arrived
          Portree, the largest city on the Isle of Skye. How lucky we were!!!

        <h1>Nature and Wildness</h1>
        <p>
          The next day, we spent all way on the Isle of Skye. It was another
          sunny day. I really cherished this moment because it is rare in
          Scotland, not to mention the Isle of Skye. The first spot we went was
          Fairy Pools. It entices visitors from all over the world every year,
          as they make some great ‘Wild Swimming’ for those brave enough to
          enter the cold water. For me, I was tolerated enough of cold weather
          in Canada, and thus I chose to walk on the trails and took fantastic
          photos only. The thing that amazed me the most in Fairy Pools was
          glacial terrain. For a person who grew up in a tropical island. It was
          really rare to see glacier in person. The knowledge I had for glaciers
          was from my geography class, but I could see the U-shaped valley in
          person while walking on the trails. This was so amazing and I told
          myself I should be humbler in front of mother nature. The power of
          mother nature is really impressive.

        <p>
          In the afternoon, we went hiking, on the way to the top of the hills, 
          I could feel how strong the wind from nordic Sea. At that time,
           I realized why the Nordic Sea is viewed as one of the best spots in the world to develop wind energy. 
           I still wanted to show my gradtitude again. It was difficult to get a suuny day on Skye, but we had it. 
           It gave us a chance to go hiking and experince how an island which was once covered by glaciers.
            Ａdditionally, the isle of Skye used to be a volconic island, the rocks there are precipitous.

        <h1>Seafood and Whiskies</h1>
        <p>
          Coming from an island (PEI) has similar latitude as the Skye. I was
          still impressive to the seafood on the Isle of Skye. It is fresh and
          cheaper than what I ate in PEI. After five more days of eating British
          food, I finally got a chance to taste the delicious food. Another
          thing I could not miss was whiskies. I am not a big fan of whiskies,
          but I was still willing to try whiskies to prove I have been to the
          Isle of Skye. Scotland, the most famous and largest place to produce
          whiskies, and highland is one of the origins. Therefore, I was glad
          that I got a chance to visit one of the oldest whiskey distilleries on
          the Skye.

      <div>
        <h1>Gaelic tradition and Scotland cultures</h1>
        <p>
          The Gaelic language, also known as Scottish Gaelic, is still spoken by
          a small number of people on the island. Signs throughout Skye are
          often bilingual, with both English and Gaelic names for places and
          landmarks. Gaelic is also taught in some schools on the island, and
          there are efforts to preserve and promote the language. This can be
          seen on the way to Skye from Edinburgh. When we entered the highland,
          the first line of road sign is Gaelic instead of English. This made me
          remind my trip in Cape Breton in Canada, another island with many
          Gaelic population and spending many efforts to preserve and promote
          Gaelic. After watching sunset in Portree, we encountered a parade on
          the main street. It was traditional performance of Scotland marching
          band. When I was in Edinburgh, I have been to the Edinburgh Military
          Tattoo. It was great and unbelievable. However, I prefer to watch the
          one while walking on the street because it is more localized and
          traditional.

        <h1>The chat with hostel owner</h1>
        <p>
          In the last day, I had a small chat with hostel owner before going
          back to Edinburgh. When he asked me where I am from, I told him I am
          from PEI. He was surprised. I still remembered how surprised he was at
          that time. When he knew I am from PEI, he started to take out his map
          and explained how Scot immigrated to PEI. How close the relationship
          between PEI and the Isle of Skye. It is really interested to
          understand the history of those ancestors immigrated from one island
          to another island, especially I found the similarity of cultures while
          being on these two islands.

        <h1>Islandness of the Isle of Skye</h1>
        <p>
          The trip to Skye was unforgettable, I got three sunny days when I was
          there, it was really rare in Scotland. I saw the glacier landscape
          while I was there, and experienced the strong wind from Nordic Ocean
          in person. The soil there was poor, and thus the
          economy of Skye is highly depending on tourism. Most of people went to
          Fort William to work in the off-season, and this made this island more
          depressed and wilder. I would say the islandess of Skye is cloudy
          weather (although I didn’t meet it, I still can image) nature,
          glacier, seafood, whiskies, wind and Gaelic as well as Scotland
          cultures.
